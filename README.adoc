== Abstract
image::agrirouter.svg[agrirouter]

The agrirouter is a universal data exchange platform for farmers and agricultural contractors that makes it possible to connect machinery and agricultural software, regardless of vendor or manufacturer. Agrirouter does not save data; it transfers data.
As a universal data exchange platform, agrirouter fills a gap on the way to Farming 4.0. Its underlying concept unites cross-vendor and discrimination-free data transfer. You retain full control over your data. Even data exchange with service providers (e.g. agricultural contractors) and other partners is uncomplicated: Data are very rapidly transferred via the online connection, and if you wish, is intelligently connected to other datasets.



== The current project you are looking at
The agrirouter postman tools can be used to onboard endpoints to check simulate the onboarding.
The Postman Collection includes request templates for onboarding, message sending to the inbox and message requesting from the outbox.
The nodejs servers are used to provide some required functionalities that could not be implemented in postman.

== Setup

* Get Postman: https://www.getpostman.com/ 
* Import the postman collection from folder "postman" (for further information see link:https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/collections/data_formats[here] )
* (For FMIS and Telemetry Platforms only):
** Install nodejs (see https://nodejs.org/en/)
** Install putty (see https://www.putty.org/ )
** Install an editor (e.g. notepad++)
* Get OpenSSL (see https://www.openssl.org/)


== Usage
=== Onboarding

Decide, if you want to onboard a CU or a farming software or a telemetry platform

==== Preparation
* Select Environment (we advice __agrirouter-QA eu10__)
++++
<p align="center">
 <img src="./assets/images/select_environment.png"><br>
 <i>Select environment</i>
</p>
++++

==== Onboard a CU: 
* Receive a registration code through the agrirouter UI (see https://lb.my-agrirouter.com/en/connect-the-machine/ )
* Open Request "Onboarding CU" and select Onboarding Request in Postman
* Enter your app information in the "PreRequestScripts"
** __endpoint_reg_code__ is where the registration token from the authorization request shall be stored
** __reg_external_id__ use this to create an external id; we advice a UUID of form urn:uuid:324234....
* Send Request

**=> Receive onboarded app credentials**

=> The data is written to different environment variables


==== Onboard a farming software or a telemetry platform:
===== Authorization

Receive a registration code throught the authorization process (see Authorization Server below)

===== Onboarding

* Open Request Onboarding FMIS&Telemetry and select __01_GetSignature__
* Enter your app information in the PreRequestScripts
** __private_key__ is the private key you received when setting up your application in the agrirouter UI, see https://github.com/DKE-Data/agrirouter-interface-documentation/blob/develop/docs/integration/authorization.adoc )
** __endpoint_reg_code__ is where the registration token from the authorization request shall be stored
** __reg_external_id__ use this to create an external id; we advice a UUID of form urn:uuid:324234....
* Setup and start the node server for signature creation (see Node Server for Signature Creation)
* Send Request 
**=> You will receive the signature which is required for the secured onboarding**
* (optional) Select request __02_Verify Request Secure__ and click send to get an account id and to check, if the data you received so far is valid
* Select Request __03_Onboarding Request Secure__ and click send to receive the onboarding credentials

**=> Receive onboarded app credentials**

=> The data is written to different environment variables

==== Save certificates to be used with postman for agrirouter

* Open Environment variables list by clicking 
++++
<p align="center">
 <img src="./assets/images/env_variables_symbol.png"><br>
 <i>Open environment variables</i>
</p>
++++
* Copy value of environment variable _endpointAuthCertificate_
* Open Nodepad++ or an editor and replace "\n" by an actual line break 
++++
<p align="center">
 <img src="./assets/images/replace_linebreaks.png"><br>
 <i>Replace Linebreaks</i>
</p>
++++
* Save the first part of the text ("-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY----- ... -----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----" ) to a file __private.key__
* Save the second part of the text ("-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- ... -----END CERTIFICATE-----") to a file __key.cert__
* To use the certificate in postman, it needs to be converted, e.g. using openssl.
** Start command line and navigate to the folder where the key-file is stored.
** Run __openssl pkey -in private.key -out serv.key -des3__
** As password, use the value from __endpointAuthSecret__  (as well for the new password)


=== Communication with an endpoint
==== Preparation
For communication with agrirouter, you need to setup the credentials. They are automatically added, when you performed the onboarding process before.

The certificates required for communication need to be added by hand:
++++
<p align="center">
 <img src="./assets/images/certificate.png"><br>
 <i>Adding the certificate in Postman</i>
</p>
++++

* As private key, use __serv.key__
* As certificate, use __key.cert__
* The passkey can be found in the environment variable __endpointAuthSecret__

=== Sending requests to the inbox
* Select __agrirouter: Messaging / 01 - Send Message to agrirouter__
* Set the request in the environment variable __encoded_request__
* Send the request

**Remark**
=====
Requests are base64-encoded protobuf-structures. 
Check the documentation on how to build messages

For initial tests you can use the link:https://github.com/saschadoemer/agrirouter-protobuf-toolset[agrirouter protobuf toolset]. 
=====

== Authorization Server
To create a registration code for Farming Software and Telemetry platforms, we provide a small example server tool.
It can be found in "./authorization-server"

For details on the authorization process, see https://github.com/DKE-Data/agrirouter-interface-documentation/blob/develop/docs/integration/authorization.adoc  

=== SETUP of your application

To make your application compatible with this tool, you need to setup the redirect-URL as "http://fuf.me:8080". 

=== Start authorization server
* navigate to the authorization-server folder in command line
* call __npm install__ to install all required libraries
* call __node index.js__ to run the program
* provide your applicationId
* call the echoed url
* The registration code can be found in "regcode"

== Node server for signature creation

The NodeJS Server for signature creation is required to create an application signature for the FMIS- and Telemetry onboarding process. 
It can be found in ./signature-creator.

=== Setup

* Open a console and navigate to the folder of the tool
* call __npm install__ to install all required libraries
* call __node index.js__ to run the program
